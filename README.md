----------------------------------

/ ! \ BEFORE STARTING: Be sure that you have created a repository named 'dict'. If it is not the case, your programs will not work at all ...

How to use the Super-Encryptator ?

* Compilation: there is a MakeFile. 
  make key_generator: program to generate a dictionary file.
	make encrypt: to encrypt a text file. You must have generated a dictionary file before.
	make decrypt: to decrypt a text file. You must have generated a dictionary file before.
	make tests: to compile the tests program.
	make: compilation of all programs.
	
* Generate a dictionary file:
	Use the program key_generator with 2 arguments: the secret key, and a name for the output file.
	E.G.: A file name 'dict1' with the key 'AZERTY':
		WINDOWS: ./key_generator.exe AZERTY dict1
		MAC/UNIX: ./key_generator AZERTY dict1
	
* Encrypt a text file: 
	Use the program encrypt with 3 arguments: the dictionary file, the original text file to encrypt, the output text file name.
	E.G.: Use 'dict1' to encrypt 'example.txt' into 'enc.txt'
		WINDOWS: ./encrypt.exe dict1 example.txt enc.txt
		MAC/UNIX: ./encrypt dict1 example.txt enc.txt
		
* Decrypt a text file: 
	Use the program decrypt with 3 arguments: the dictionary file, the encrypted text file to decrypt, the output text file name.
	E.G.: Use 'dict1' to decrypt 'enc.txt' into 'dec.txt'
		WINDOWS: ./decrypt.exe dict1 enc.txt dec.txt
		MAC/UNIX: ./decrypt dict1 enc.txt dec.txt
